# Area Control
Area Control is a GTA V mod which allows you to control the area around you and prevent chaos from happening.
You can request the road to be closed, which will call backup units to close and redirect the traffic.

## Features

### Clear surrounding area
Use nearby cops for cleaning wrecks and death bodies in the surrounding area of the player (integration with Arrest Manager).

### Close Road
Closes the road closest to the player & cleans the road area from wrecks and death bodies (integration with Arrest Manager).
